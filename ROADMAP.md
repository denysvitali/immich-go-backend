## Current Status

**Phase Completed:** 3/10
**Overall Progress:** ~30%

**Currently Working On:** Phase 4 - Core Services
**Next Milestone:** Complete Authentication Service

## Key Achievements

1. ✅ **Robust Storage Abstraction**: Implemented a comprehensive storage layer supporting local filesystem, S3, and rclone backends with pre-signed URL support
2. ✅ **Comprehensive Database Layer**: 116 SQLC queries covering all Immich entities with proper error handling
3. ✅ **Production-Ready Configuration**: Full configuration system with YAML and environment variable support
4. ✅ **Observability Ready**: OpenTelemetry integration with tracing and metrics
5. ✅ **Protocol Buffer Integration**: Complete protobuf setup with Nix build system

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Authentication Service** - JWT tokens, user registration/login, session management
2. **Create HTTP Controllers** - REST API endpoints for all major functionality
3. **Add Job Queue System** - Background processing for thumbnails, EXIF extraction, etc.
4. **Implement gRPC Services** - Complete protobuf service implementations
5. **Add Testing Infrastructure** - Unit and integration tests

## Technical Decisions Made

- **Storage**: Rclone-based abstraction for maximum flexibility
- **Database**: SQLC for type-safe SQL queries
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry with autoexport for vendor-neutral monitoring
- **Configuration**: YAML + environment variables for 12-factor app compliance
- **Build System**: Nix for reproducible builds
- **Architecture**: Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
