# Immich Go Backend Implementation Roadmap

## Upstream Compatibility Check (2026-06-16)

**Current stable Immich baseline:** v2.7.5 (released 2026-04-13)
**Latest upstream preview:** v3.0.0-rc.0 (released 2026-06-15)
**Current repo status:** all original 10 phases ✅; recent session shipped (1) `isOnboarded` on `LoginResponse`, (2) sanitized internal errors via `SanitizedInternal` helper, (3) `openapi-coverage` subcommand, (4) asset-viewer integration tests, (5) CI speedup from ~12 min to ~2.3 min wall-clock.
**Sources:** [Immich releases](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases), [Immich OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/blob/main/open-api/immich-openapi-specs.json), [OAuth docs](https://docs.immich.app/administration/oauth)

The earlier phase checklist tracks implementation breadth, but it overstates compatibility. The active roadmap is now API parity and behavior hardening against upstream Immich, using v2.7.5 as the stable target and v3.0.0-rc.0 as forward-looking input.

### Latest Immich Changes To Track
- [x] v2 stable auth surface check: no current `/auth/refresh` endpoint in upstream OpenAPI; treat the README refresh-token item as stale until a client requires it.
- [x] v2 stable OAuth mobile redirect route: `/api/oauth/mobile-redirect` should forward to `app.immich:///oauth-callback` with original query parameters.
- [ ] v2.7.x shared link and auth fixes: review shared-link asset removal permissions and version-check rate limiting/deduplication.
- [ ] v2.7.x media fixes: verify original filename hiding when metadata is disabled and people search behavior for short queries.
- [x] v3 RC breaking API changes: remove old timeline sync assumptions, audit removed endpoints, album ownership model changes, **sanitized error responses** (done — `internal/server/errors.go` `SanitizedInternal` helper now wraps all 97 `codes.Internal` call sites), and structured validation errors.
- [ ] v3 RC new capabilities: workflows/plugins parity, HLS real-time transcoding, integrity report jobs, **recently added assets** (in progress), OAuth backchannel logout, full-path search, album map markers, and user upload heatmap.
- [ ] v3 RC database/runtime changes: assess pgvecto.rs removal implications and duration-in-milliseconds response changes.

### Active Compatibility Backlog
- [x] Implement `/api/oauth/mobile-redirect` HTTP redirect compatibility.
- [x] Audit OAuth callback/login responses against upstream `LoginResponseDto`, including cookie behavior. *(Added `isOnboarded` field; mark-on-first-login semantics; integration tests gated behind `//go:build integration`.)*
- [x] Replace internal-error details in public API responses with sanitized messages. *(New `SanitizedInternal(ctx, publicMsg, err)` helper in `internal/server/errors.go`; migrated 97 call sites across 14 server files.)*
- [x] Add upstream OpenAPI diff tooling or a generated endpoint coverage report. *(New `immich-go-backend openapi-coverage` subcommand; JSON + markdown output; matches upstream Immich OpenAPI paths against the generated grpc-gateway routes.)*
- [x] Expand integration tests around mobile-login, shared links, timeline, and asset-viewer API flows. *(New `internal/server/asset_viewer_integration_test.go` covers `GetAsset` / `GetAssetThumbnail` / `GetAssetOriginal` with real testcontainers Postgres; existing suites for mobile-redirect, shared links, and timeline already comprehensive.)*

### Recently Shipped (2026-06-16 session)
| Change | Commit | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `is_onboarded` on `LoginResponse` (upstream `LoginResponseDto` parity) | `322876e` + `e879c74` | Auto-marked `true` on first successful login; integration tests gated behind `//go:build integration` |
| Sanitized internal errors (97 sites) | `b02cfb0` | `SanitizedInternal(ctx, publicMsg, err)` records `err` on the OTel span but never includes it in the gRPC status message |
| OpenAPI coverage subcommand | `0e566e4` + `ba6b4d3` + `1bdaf05` | `immich-go-backend openapi-coverage -md` prints a coverage report (JSON + markdown) |
| Asset viewer integration tests | `bbad77e` | `GetAsset`, `GetAssetThumbnail`, `GetAssetOriginal` with user isolation |
| CI speedup | `5e2de87` + `eb48f2d` + `b805175` | 12 min → 2.3 min. No Nix in non-Docker jobs; Trivy moved to nightly; `bufbuild/buf-action@v1` with `setup_only: true` |

## Current Status

**Phases Completed:** 10/10 for the original prototype milestone
**Overall Compatibility Progress:** ~60% API coverage estimate

The Immich Go Backend has broad service coverage, real database operations, and production-style infrastructure, but it is not yet production-ready or fully Immich-compatible. The remaining work is primarily upstream API parity, client behavior compatibility, security hardening, and regression coverage.

## Key Achievements

1. ✅ **Robust Storage Abstraction**: Comprehensive storage layer supporting local filesystem, S3, and rclone backends with pre-signed URL support
2. ✅ **Comprehensive Database Layer**: 130+ SQLC queries covering all Immich entities with proper error handling
3. ✅ **Production-Ready Configuration**: Full configuration system with YAML and environment variable support
4. ✅ **Observability Ready**: OpenTelemetry integration with tracing and metrics
5. ✅ **Protocol Buffer Integration**: Complete protobuf setup with Nix build system
6. ✅ **Complete Authentication System**: JWT tokens, user registration/login, session management, OAuth support
7. ✅ **Full User Management**: CRUD operations, profile management, preferences, admin functions with gRPC endpoints
8. ✅ **Complete Asset Management**: Upload/download with S3 pre-signed URLs, metadata extraction, thumbnail generation, advanced search, stacks, and comprehensive deletion with cleanup
9. ✅ **Album Management**: Full CRUD, sharing, permissions with real database operations
10. ✅ **Additional Services**: Tags, partners, shared links, duplicates, trash, memories, timeline, notifications
11. ✅ **Job Queue System**: Redis-based background processing with handlers for all job types
12. ✅ **gRPC/REST API**: Complete API layer with 30+ services and authentication interceptors
13. ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests and integration tests for all major services
14. ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with build, test, lint, security scanning, and Docker build
15. ✅ **Containerization**: Multi-stage Dockerfile and docker-compose for development

## Future Enhancements

1. **ML Integration** - Face recognition, smart search with CLIP (optional)
2. **Video Processing** - Full transcoding pipeline with ffmpeg
3. **Performance Testing** - Load testing and optimization
4. **Monitoring Dashboards** - Grafana dashboards and alerting
5. **Kubernetes Deployment** - Helm charts for production deployment

## Technical Decisions Made

- **Storage**: Rclone-based abstraction for maximum flexibility
- **Database**: SQLC for type-safe SQL queries
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry with autoexport for vendor-neutral monitoring
- **Configuration**: YAML + environment variables for 12-factor app compliance
- **Build System**: Nix for reproducible builds
- **Architecture**: Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **API**: gRPC with grpc-gateway for REST compatibility
- **Testing**: Integration tests with Docker-based PostgreSQL
