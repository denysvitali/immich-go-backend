## Current Status

**Phase Completed:** 4/10
**Overall Progress:** ~40%

**Currently Working On:** Phase 4 - Core Services (User Management ✅ Complete, Asset Management in progress)
**Next Milestone:** Complete Asset Management Service

## Key Achievements

1. ✅ **Robust Storage Abstraction**: Implemented a comprehensive storage layer supporting local filesystem, S3, and rclone backends with pre-signed URL support
2. ✅ **Comprehensive Database Layer**: 116 SQLC queries covering all Immich entities with proper error handling
3. ✅ **Production-Ready Configuration**: Full configuration system with YAML and environment variable support
4. ✅ **Observability Ready**: OpenTelemetry integration with tracing and metrics
5. ✅ **Protocol Buffer Integration**: Complete protobuf setup with Nix build system
6. ✅ **Complete Authentication System**: JWT tokens, user registration/login, session management, password validation
7. ✅ **Full User Management**: CRUD operations, profile management, preferences, admin functions with gRPC endpoints

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Asset Management Service** - Asset upload/download, metadata extraction, thumbnail generation
2. **Finish Album Management Service** - Complete album sharing and permissions
3. **Add Job Queue System** - Background processing for thumbnails, EXIF extraction, etc.
4. **Complete HTTP Controllers** - REST API endpoints for all major functionality
5. **Add Testing Infrastructure** - Unit and integration tests

## Technical Decisions Made

- **Storage**: Rclone-based abstraction for maximum flexibility
