## IMMEDIATE BLOCKERS TO RESOLVE

### 1. Missing Database Queries (‚úÖ RESOLVED)
The following SQL queries have been added and manually implemented:
- ‚úÖ SearchAssets - Full text search across assets
- ‚úÖ CountSearchAssets - Count results for pagination
- ‚úÖ SearchPeople - Search for people by name
- ‚úÖ SearchPlaces - Search for places
- ‚úÖ GetDistinctCities - Get unique cities for suggestions
- ‚úÖ GetTopPeople - Get most photographed people
- ‚úÖ CheckAssetExistsByPath - Check if asset exists by file path
- ‚úÖ GetLibraryAssetCount - Count assets in a library

**Note**: Manual implementations created in `internal/db/sqlc/search_queries.go`
When SQLC can be run, regenerate with `make sqlc-gen`

### 2. OAuth Proto Mismatch (HIGH)
- Proto definitions in oauth.proto don't match server implementation
- Fields like provider, code, state are missing from request/response messages
- Need to regenerate protobuf files after fixing proto definitions

## Work Completed in This Session (2025-08-25)

### ‚úÖ Major Achievements:
1. **Added Missing Services to Server**:
   - Integrated Search, Library, and API Key services
   - Created server implementations for Search and Library endpoints
   - Fixed service initialization and dependency injection

2. **Fixed Database Compatibility Issues**:
   - Created utility functions for UUID and timestamp conversions
   - Fixed pgtype/uuid mismatches throughout the codebase
   - Adapted services to work with actual database schema

3. **Added Critical Missing Queries**:
   - Added 8 essential search and library queries to queries.sql

   - Ready for SQLC code generation

4. **Updated OAuth Proto Definitions**:
   - Added missing fields (provider, code, state) to OAuth messages
   - Fixed request/response structures to match implementation

### üîß Next Immediate Steps:

2. Run `make proto-gen` to regenerate protobuf files
3. Fix any remaining compilation errors
4. Implement job queue system for background processing
5. Complete remaining API endpoints

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues Remaining:
