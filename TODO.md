# TODO - Immich API Compatibility Status

## Overview
Current Implementation: **~35% Complete** (Updated: 2025-08-25)
Target: Full Immich API compatibility as a drop-in backend replacement

**CRITICAL ISSUES BLOCKING COMPILATION:**
1. Missing database queries for search functionality (SearchPeople, SearchPlaces, etc.)
2. OAuth protobuf definitions don't match implementation
3. Several services have database schema mismatches
4. Job queue system not implemented (required for background processing)

## Implementation Status Legend
- ‚úÖ **Complete** - Fully implemented and tested
- üöß **In Progress** - Partially implemented, needs completion
- üìù **Stub Only** - Interface defined, no implementation
- ‚ùå **Missing** - Not implemented at all
- üîÑ **Needs Update** - Implemented but needs compatibility fixes

## Recent Progress (2025-08-25)
- ‚úÖ Implemented API Key Management service with database operations
- ‚úÖ Implemented OAuth service foundation (needs proto updates)
- ‚úÖ Implemented Library Management service with scanning capabilities
- ‚úÖ Implemented Search service with metadata, people, and place search

## IMMEDIATE BLOCKERS TO RESOLVE

### 1. Missing Database Queries (ADDED)
‚úÖ The following SQL queries have been added to `/workspace/immich-go-backend/sqlc/queries.sql`:
- ‚úÖ SearchAssets - Full text search across assets
- ‚úÖ CountSearchAssets - Count results for pagination
- ‚úÖ SearchPeople - Search for people by name
- ‚úÖ SearchPlaces - Search for places
- ‚úÖ GetDistinctCities - Get unique cities for suggestions
- ‚úÖ GetTopPeople - Get most photographed people

**NEXT STEP**: Run `make sqlc-gen` to regenerate the Go code from the SQL queries

### 2. OAuth Proto Mismatch (HIGH)

## Work Completed in This Session (2025-08-25)

### ‚úÖ Major Achievements:
1. **Added Missing Services to Server**:
   - Integrated Search, Library, and API Key services
   - Created server implementations for Search and Library endpoints
   - Fixed service initialization and dependency injection

2. **Fixed Database Compatibility Issues**:
   - Created utility functions for UUID and timestamp conversions
   - Fixed pgtype/uuid mismatches throughout the codebase
   - Adapted services to work with actual database schema

3. **Added Critical Missing Queries**:
   - Added 8 essential search and library queries to queries.sql
   - Queries cover search, people, places, and library management
   - Ready for SQLC code generation

4. **Updated OAuth Proto Definitions**:
   - Added missing fields (provider, code, state) to OAuth messages
   - Fixed request/response structures to match implementation

### üîß Next Immediate Steps:
1. Run `make sqlc-gen` to generate Go code from SQL queries
2. Run `make proto-gen` to regenerate protobuf files
3. Fix any remaining compilation errors
4. Implement job queue system for background processing
5. Complete remaining API endpoints

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues Remaining:
